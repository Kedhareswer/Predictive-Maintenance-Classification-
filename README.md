## Objective
This project aims to design a machine learning model that predicts machine failure based on operational and environmental factors, minimizing unplanned downtimes through timely maintenance interventions.

## Key Objectives:
- **Failure Prediction**: Classify whether a machine is likely to fail based on operational features such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.
- **Identify Failure Modes**: Determine the exact failure mode when a failure occurs, targeting maintenance at specific failure modes.
- **Optimization of Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance only when necessary, reducing unnecessary servicing while avoiding breakdowns.
- **Cost Reduction**: Prevent unexpected failures, reducing the financial burden of downtime, emergency repairs, and machine replacement.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze features such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear to understand operational parameters influencing machine performance and failures.

## Approach
### Data Preparation
- **Dataset**: Utilized a synthetic dataset with 10,000 instances and 14 features.
- **Preprocessing**: Applied feature extraction methods to trim and process data for model robustness.

### Model Architecture
Employed multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Training
Conducted holistic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to capture feature correlation and address data imbalances. Fine-tuned models and evaluated performance across various metrics.

### Evaluation
Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance. Ensured maximization of accuracy and reliability in failure prediction.

## Results
Random Forest and SVM models achieved near-perfect classification accuracy for predicting system failures. Demonstrated the effectiveness of complex ensemble methods in predictive maintenance.

## Key Insights
- Holistic EDA and addressing data imbalances were crucial for accurate failure prediction.
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest and SVM closely approximated high classification accuracy.

## Future Work
- Experiment with larger and more diverse datasets for broader generalization.
- Extend models to support real-time failure prediction and maintenance scheduling.
